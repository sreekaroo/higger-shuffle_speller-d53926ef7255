CSL DAQ Library

== TLDR ==

This repo contains source code for CSL DAQ that runs gUSBAmp in 32 and 64 bit architectures.

If you don't want to read more (eg. not enough time due to paper deadline), but want to use it right away,
add the matlab folder to your path and check out matlab/DAQgUSBAmp.m and test/DAQgUSBAmpTest.m for examples

Library has been tested in windows 7 (32 and 64 bit) and 8 (64 bit) with Matlab 32bit and 64bit.
We require Matlab 2013b or newer. 

Make sure you have the correct drivers for gUsbAmp: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7QZQiQGCtnecWZnTnNfc0QtbWs

If you want to compile from source, install the C-API (not needed to run):  https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7QZQiQGCtneaHJTcmcyV3FGalk

Here is the order of execution for general usage::
(0) Turn on device and connect USB cable
(1) Constructor: opens and inits device
(2) OpenDevice
(3) StartAcquisition: starts getting data (and put to file if enabled)
(4) GetData, GetTrial, or do nothing
(5) StopAcquistion: stops getting data and closes file if applicable
(6) repeat (2)-(4) if needed
(7) CloseDevice: good practice to call but the destructor will clean up
                 appropiatedly

The doc folder contains more documentation on how this library is structured. The software was designed to
be used from Matlab or C++ directly.
